<!-- Key Note -->
<!-- The browser renders the html document from top to bottom and element by element.

The styling i.e internal stle tag and external css whichever is mentioned first in the
HTML code gets applied first and then second styling. 

Inline styling gets applied at the end and overrides the other styling 

The <link> tag should be present inside the <head> tag of the HTML. Even though HTML
never throws any error, this is a rule
!-->
